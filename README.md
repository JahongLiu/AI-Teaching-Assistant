# AI-Teaching-Assistant

## Introduction
Dr. Gary was concerned about students using AI tools like ChatGPT in the Object-Oriented Design class, fearing they might rely on copying and pasting from AI without truly understanding the concepts. Additionally, there was the risk of AI-generated hallucinations misleading students.

I believe that AI tools can significantly enhance student productivity when used appropriately. To balance the benefits of AI with the need for deep understanding, I'm creating an AI Teaching Assistant. This AI would be tailored to answer questions based solely on the course materials, ensuring it doesn't give students too much code and help while providing accurate answers. This approach would also free up the TAs to focus on more complex and unique student queries.
